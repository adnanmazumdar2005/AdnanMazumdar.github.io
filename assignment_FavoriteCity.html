                    My favorite city is Tokyo.
                    <br>
                    Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is a city that blends the ultramodern with the traditional,
                    from neon-lit skyscrapers to peaceful, historic temples. Located at the head of Tokyo Bay,
                    it sits in the Kant≈ç region on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. The city's
                    vibrant energy and endless attractions make it a place that always seems to be alive with
                    excitement, and it's no wonder that it's often at the top of many travel lists. I've always
                    dreamed of visiting Tokyo, to experience its unique mix of modern wonders and ancient
                    traditions firsthand.
